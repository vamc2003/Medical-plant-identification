# Medical-plant-identification
The Medicinal Plant Identification through Image Processing using CNN project aims to automate the process of recognizing and classifying medicinal plants using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This system uses image processing techniques to extract visual features from leaf images—such as shape, color, and texture.
